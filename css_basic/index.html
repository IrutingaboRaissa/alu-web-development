<h1>Values</h1>
<h2>My top three important values for people to live peacefully.</h2>
<h3>Based on a personal opinion</h3> 
<p> A value is something that a person has and helps to live the way he lives.<br> Values are important to for the people from similar or different backgrounds to live in harmony.<br>
<p> 1. Modesty : is having or showing a moderate or humble estimate of one's merits, importance, etc.<br>; free from vanity, egotism, boastfulness, or great pretensions.<br> </p>  

<p> 2. Modesty: is the ability to always tell the truth, never stealing or cheating. Not hiding the truth about something, being sincere. Being able to share honestly how you feel.</p>
<p> 3. Empathy: the ability to put yourself in someone else's shoes and imagine how or what they may be feeling.<br>
Empathic people understand that other people are effected by difficult situations and circumstances, so they make sure to be there for others and provide necessary assistance.<br> </p>
